# Weather Application

This is a beginner project to learn React by building a weather application. As my first React project, it helped me understand the basics of React and how to create a functional web application.

## Features

- Search for weather information by city name
- Displays current weather conditions, including temperature and weather type
- Handles different weather scenarios (hot, cold, rainy)

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the application [here](https://main--react-weatherr-ap.netlify.app/).

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd weather-app

3. Install the dependencies:

   npm install

4. Start the development server:

   npm start
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.   
## Usage
Enter a city name into the search field to view the weather information for that location. The application will display the current weather along with an appropriate image based on the temperature and weather conditions.
